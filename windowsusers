Improving Cyber Security on a Windows PC

Windows PCs are more vulnerable to cyber threats than Macs, but there are several steps you can take to improve the security of your computer and protect your data:

    Enable firewalls: Windows PCs come with a built-in firewall that you can enable in the Control Panel. Enabling the firewall can help prevent unauthorized access to your computer.

    Install antivirus software: It's essential to install antivirus software on your Windows PC to protect against malware and other security threats.

    Keep your operating system and applications up to date: Microsoft regularly releases updates for its operating system and applications to fix security vulnerabilities. Make sure to keep your PC up to date by going to the Windows Update section of the Control Panel and installing the latest updates.

    Use strong and unique passwords: Choose strong, unique passwords for your accounts and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of protection.

    Be cautious when installing or downloading software: Be careful when installing or downloading software from the internet, as some programs can contain malware or other security threats. Only download software from reputable sources.

    Enable BitLocker: BitLocker is a built-in encryption tool that can help protect your data by encrypting your hard drive. To enable BitLocker, go to the Control Panel and click the "Turn On BitLocker" button.

By following these steps, you can significantly improve the security of your Windows PC and protect your data from cyber threats.
